# Learning and Robust Control for Robotic Tasks

---

### Evaluating the robustness of learned control policies for robotic tasks:

The agent is designed according to the standard robotics paradigm Sense-Plan-Act. In this project the Sense and Act
modules are utilized for assessing the planner's robustness against noise and domain shift in observations as well as
during the execution of actions.

---

### Run the experiments:

Requirements:
- Python 3.6+
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

To install all requirements a virtual python environment is recommended which can be installed using the command:

```bash install.sh```.

To run an experiment use the following command inside the virtual environment:

```python train.py```
